Bitcoin Instant Trade Bot

I've decided to learn Python, and am teaching myself by creating a simple automated Bitcoin trader.

The bot will grab live price information from the MtGox exchange and decide whether to buy or sell bitcoin.

Also there is a module which scrapes historic price info to a CouchDB so that we can test trading algorithms on historic data before setting them loose in real time.

Also planned is a CouchApp which will display market info, bot status, and let you controll the bot by passing it messages through CouchDB

Instructions on getting BitBot up and running will come when it is more polished
